# Visual Studio Code Troubleshooting and Error Correction Documentation
## Introduction
Visual Studio Code or VS Code is an integrated development environment that has many valuable features. It is one of the most commonly used IDE's and can be a great tool!

In this documentation, I will highlight the high-level issues and cover them in as much detail as possible.
